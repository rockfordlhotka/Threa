# Threa TTRPG Assitant

This repo contains a web-based player and GM assistant for the Threa TTRPG gaming system.

The goal is for this assistant to help players manage and play their characters, including a rich and interactive character sheet with automation. And also to help the GM of a game (table) manage the game, including the flow of time, things triggered by time (such as healing, spell effects, etc.), combat, and more.
