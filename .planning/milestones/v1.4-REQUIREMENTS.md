## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Player-initiated health manipulation | GM-only power; players manage via combat/rest |
| Direct current pool editing | Pending pools are the safe GM interface; avoids bypassing game rules |
| Bulk effect application (to multiple characters) | Single-character focus for v1.3; batch operations are future enhancement |
| Custom effect formulas/scripting | Predefined modifiers sufficient; scripting adds complexity |
| Item creation from GM panel | Item templates managed separately; GM uses existing templates |
| Character deletion by GM | Characters owned by players; GM can remove from table only |
| Automated effect expiration notifications | Effect durations auto-expire on time skip; notifications are future UX enhancement |
