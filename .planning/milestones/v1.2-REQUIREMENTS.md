## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Session logs/history within campaign | Focus on real-time management first; historical tracking is future enhancement |
| Campaign sharing between GMs | Single GM per campaign simplifies permissions and ownership |
| Player chat/messaging within table | Out-of-game communication tools already exist (Discord, etc.) |
| Automated encounter balancing | Complex feature requiring significant game balance data |
| Initiative tracking automation | Current system has round advancement; initiative order is v1.3+ |
| Map/grid integration | Visual tactical features are separate major initiative |
| Dice rolling from GM dashboard | Players roll dice; GM uses resolver tools for NPCs (future) |
| Character templates/archetypes | Character creation feature, not table management |
